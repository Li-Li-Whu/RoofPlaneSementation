# RoofPlaneSementation
This approach is applied to detect the roof planes from the airborne lidar point clouds. 

Please download it and run the "bin\planeExtractionTest.exe" as follow:

"planeExtractionTest.exe testData\test1.txt testData\output.txt 0.01"

"0.01" is one of the parameters in the approach.  We suggest to set as 0.01 for the test data. You may need to tun this parameter for your dataset.


The source code will be uploaded as soon as possible!
